### NOTE: This project is now part of https://github.com/redhat-cop/tower_configuration and all updates will be made there directly. 


This repository contains all the required Collections, Roles, Sample configs and Playbooks that can let you configure your ansible tower using code and also let you maintain the configurations-as-code. Hence Ansible-Tower-Configuration-as-Code (ATCasC)

This is declarative way to configure AWX or Ansible Tower. You specify a list of resources you would like, whereas for imperative you specify a list of commands to run to create the resources that you want. In this repo, you just have to declare WHAT you need in `tower-configs/` directory and it takes care of HOW it can be created/achieved.

Requirements
------------
In order to execute the playbooks successfully, you would want to review following two files:

* Tower-CLI python package is needed to be installed on your computer. Also, Python3-pip. If not, `tower-cli-installer` role will attempt to install it.

* Another thing that you need to do is look at `tower-configs/` directory that will house all the configurations-as-code pieces. You don't necessarily have to have everything, but at the minimum you need to have `tower-configs/tower-hostname.yml` filled with correct hostname, username and password.

* This repo assumes you have installed the Ansible Tower or AWX and it has license added to it, if needed.

Directory structure
-------------------

We have following directories in the Repo:

* collections: This directory houses awx.awx collection that is downloaded from ansible galaxy As-is using following command:
```
ansible-galaxy collection install awx.awx -p collections/
```

* playbooks: This directory contains all the provided playbooks.

* roles: contains all the tower configuration roles.

* tower-configs: This directory houses all the files needed to config various parts of Ansible Tower.

* ansible.cfg: only config we are adding here is collections_paths, everything else is inherited from global ansible.cfg file automatically.

Playbooks in this repo
----------------------
There are 3 playbooks in this directory.
* configure-ldap-on-tower.yml : This playbook allows you to only configure LDAP on your AT, and it uses settings from `tower-configs/tower-settings-params.yml` which actually can house LDAP and other AT settings too. Since it primarily is used for LDAP, playbook is named such.

* configure-tower.yml : This playbook will call all of the Roles in `roles/` directory systematically to configure your tower using configurations from `tower-configs/` directory.

* TODO: List other playbook.



Example Execution commands
---------------------------

* To deploy tower on a VM: https://github.com/kedark3/infra-playbooks/tree/master/roles/tower-roles/deploy_ansible_tower

* To run config LDAP only:
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/configure-ldap-on-tower.yml -K
```
`-K` is needed in case you define `install_pip: true` for `tower-cli-installer` role.

* To configure tower:
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/configure-tower.yml -K
```
`-K` is needed in case you define `install_pip: true` for `tower-cli-installer` role.

* To run backup - meta only(JSON):
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/meta-json-only-backup.yml
```
Default path for backup is `backups/` in root of this repo.

* To run restore - meta only(JSON):
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/meta-json-only-restore.yml
```
Default path for backup is `backups/` in root of this repo.
